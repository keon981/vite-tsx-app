# Vite React simple template

> pnpm + React 18 + TypeScript + Vitest + Testing Library + ESlint

## Overview

> Built with type safety, scalability, and developer experience in mind. A batteries included Vite + React template.

* pnpm - A strict and efficient alternative to npm with up to 3x faster performance
* TypeScript - A typed superset of JavaScript designed with large scale applications in mind
* ESLint(Airbnb) - Static code analysis to help find problems within a codebase
* Vite@4.4 - Feature rich and highly optimized frontend tooling with TypeScript support out of the box
* SWC
* Vitest - A blazing fast unit test framework powered by Vite
* React Testing Library - A very light-weight, best practice first, solution for testing React components

## Requirements

* NodeJS 14+
* pnpm 7+

## Getting Started

Getting started is a simple as cloning the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:keon981/vite-tsx-app.git
```

Changing into the new directory

```
cd vite-tsx-app
```

Changing vite verson

```
git checkout vite@4
```

Removing the .git folder (and any additional files, folders or dependencies you may not need)

```
rm -rf .git
```

Installing dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

And running the setup script (initializes git repository)

```
pnpm run setup
```

Congrats! You're ready to starting working on that new project!

If you'd rather run the commands above in one go, check out the command below:

```
git clone git@github.com:keon981/vite-tsx-app.git &&\
cd vite-tsx-app &&\
git checkout vite@4 &&\
rm -rf .git &&\
pnpm install &&\
pnpm run setup
```

## Testing

Unit testing is handled by React Testing Library and Vitest while End-to-End (E2E) Testing is conducted by Playwright.

If you'd like to run all tests, Unit and E2E alike, execute the following command:

```
pnpm run test
```

### Unit Testing

When running unit test scripts, it is assumed that unit tests will be colocated with the source files. Take a look at the placeholder README file in `src/components` for [an example](src/components/README.md).

If you'd like to execute unit tests specifically, the below command will execute vitest:

```
pnpm run test:unit
```

If instead you are interested in coverage reporting, run:

```
pnpm run coverage
```
